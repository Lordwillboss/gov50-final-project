##I am interested in exploring data related to approval ratings for presidential candidates and the outcomes of those candidates' campaigns for higher office. I think discovering if there is a correlation between a high approval rating and an increase in odds of getting re-elected, would establish a basis for political scientists to analyze future elections; at the same time, this isn't exploring a question that has a definitive answer, as we are in the midst of a presidential re-election fight where the incumbent-presidential candidate leading in the polls has an historically low approval-rating.
